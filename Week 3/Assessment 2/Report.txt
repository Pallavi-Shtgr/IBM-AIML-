Report: Titanic Survival Prediction
Introduction
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including variables like age, gender, class, and survival status. The goal of this analysis was to predict survival using machine learning.

Data Preparation
Data Cleaning:
Missing values in Age were filled with the median, and missing Embarked values with the mode.
Irrelevant columns (PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin) were dropped.
String Manipulation:
Converted Sex and Embarked to lowercase and applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
Basic Statistics
Using NumPy:

Mean Age: 29.70, Median Age: 28.00
Mean Fare: 32.20, Median Fare: 14.45
Modeling
A Logistic Regression model was used to predict survival. The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

Accuracy: 81% on the test set.
Key Predictors:
Gender: Females were more likely to survive.
Class: 1st class passengers had higher survival rates.
